Art installation by [COLECTIVO「大音量コンピューター」](https://loudvolumecomputer.bandcamp.com/) premiered in [2018's edition](https://vimeo.com/291905671) of [Semibreve](https://www.festivalsemibreve.com/), a multimedia festival in Braga, Portugal. It manifests the ideas of communion, shared spaces and time, and the art-friendship duality. Together with eight artist friends, we have fused works that were originally conceived independently into a single purpose, a single entity.
