A couple of months ago I did a short educational video series together with **Orquestra de Jazz de Matosinhos** and [Minus & MrDolly](https://soundcloud.com/minus-mrdolly), talking about music and programming with [EarSketch](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/). The content was recorded in Portuguese and shootings took place at Centro de Alto Rendimento Art√≠stico, in Matosinhos.
