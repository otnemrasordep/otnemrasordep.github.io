My first presentation at a research conference (although it was done completely remotely, unfortunately)(three words ending in "tely" in a row).

More info here about the [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342048381_Musical_Smart_City_Perspectives_on_Ubiquitous_Sonification), the [video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re3chX9qW98), and the [conference](http://ubimus.inf.poa.ifrs.edu.br/).
