This is about me. ABOUT ME! 

I started by studying guitar, both classical and electric.

I then did my [MSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering at FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/cur_geral.cur_view?pv_ano_lectivo=2014&pv_curso_id=741&pv_origem=CUR&pv_tipo_cur_sigla=MI), focusing on renewable energy. Simultaneously, I completed my formation in classical guitar at the [Conservatory of Music of Porto](https://www.conservatoriodemusicadoporto.pt/) and attended (but did not finish) a Bachelor in classical guitar at [ESMAE](https://www.esmae.ipp.pt/), studying with [Artur Caldeira](https://soundcloud.com/artur-caldeira-645192303). After finding out (too late) about the marvelous research field of sound and music computing, I did a [Master in Multimedia](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/cur_geral.cur_view?pv_ano_lectivo=2016&pv_curso_id=732&pv_origem=CUR&pv_tipo_cur_sigla=M), specializing in Interactive Music and Sound Design. My [thesis](https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/bitstream/10216/121998/2/347866.pdf) was supervised by [Rui Penha](https://ruipenha.pt/) and focused on using music to explain concepts of computer science to young students. This project was carried out at [CARA](https://www.ojm.pt/tipo-de-projeto/cara/), home of [Orquestra de Jazz de Matosinhos](https://www.ojm.pt/), with whom I still collaborate. Recently I've enrolled on a PhD at Queen Mary University of London, working within the [Centre for Digital Music](https://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), being part of the [Artificial Intelligence and Music](https://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk/) doctoral programme. 

Currently, my [research](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pedro_Sarmento9) focuses on music generation, sonification and smart cities.

I volunteer for an [online music magazine](https://www.wavmagazine.net/), writing album reviews and reports about the most harsh and heavy sonories.
